## 📋 PROBLEM STATEMENT

### **Core UI/UX Challenges**
The Romanian freight forwarding order management system requires a sophisticated user interface that balances complex business workflows with intuitive user experience. Key challenges include:

1. **Complex Workflow Visualization**: Order lifecycle from document upload → AI processing → validation → shipment tracking → invoicing
2. **Romanian Business Context**: Cultural expectations, language considerations, and local business practices
3. **Real-time Status Communication**: Multiple concurrent orders with dynamic status updates
4. **Multi-device Accessibility**: Desktop-primary with tablet/mobile support for field operations
5. **Information Density**: Dense freight forwarding data presented in digestible, actionable formats

### **User Personas**
- **Primary**: Romanian freight forwarding dispatchers (expert users, high frequency)
- **Secondary**: Management oversight (periodic reporting, analytics focus)
- **Tertiary**: Field operations (mobile access, status updates)

### **Success Criteria**
- Reduce order processing time from 15+ minutes to <5 minutes
- Minimize clicks required for common workflows
- Ensure 95%+ user task completion rate
- Support Romanian language and business customs
- Maintain sub-2 second page load times
