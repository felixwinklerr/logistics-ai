## ðŸŽ¨ CREATIVE PHASE 1: PROFIT CALCULATION ALGORITHM

### **Selected Solution: Business Rules Engine**

**Decision Rationale**:
- Optimal balance of sophistication and maintainability for MVP
- Native support for Romanian business regulations and VAT requirements
- Meets <50ms performance requirement with rule-based evaluation
- Clear, testable architecture that business users can understand
- Future evolution path to ML-enhanced calculations

**Implementation Architecture**:
- **ProfitCalculationEngine**: Main orchestrator with pipeline pattern
- **CurrencyService**: EUR/RON conversion with real-time rates  
- **VATCalculationService**: Romanian VAT rules (19%, B2B exemptions)
- **BusinessRulesService**: Configurable rule evaluation engine
- **AuditService**: Comprehensive calculation logging

**Business Rules Pipeline**:
1. Base Calculation: `profit_margin = client_offered_price - subcontractor_price`
2. Currency Normalization: Convert all values to EUR for calculations
3. VAT Handling: Apply Romanian VAT rules based on VAT status
4. Margin Validation: Check minimum margin requirements (configurable)
5. Fee Calculations: Apply fixed fees, percentage fees, or combined structures
6. Percentage Calculation: `profit_percentage = (profit_margin / client_offered_price) * 100`
7. Audit Logging: Record all calculation steps with timestamps

## ðŸŽ¨ CREATIVE PHASE 2: POSTGIS INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### **Selected Solution: Geographic Service Layer**

**Decision Rationale**:
- Clean service abstraction supports complex geographic operations
- Future flexibility for integrating additional mapping services
- Service interface enables comprehensive mocking and testing
- Dedicated caching and query optimization strategies
- Full Pydantic integration with coordinate validation
- Romanian-specific geocoding and postal service integration ready

**Service Architecture**:
```
GeographicService (Interface)
    â”œâ”€â”€ CoordinateService: Conversion and validation
    â”œâ”€â”€ DistanceService: Distance calculations and routing  
    â”œâ”€â”€ GeocodingService: Address to coordinate conversion
    â”œâ”€â”€ SpatialQueryService: PostGIS spatial operations
    â””â”€â”€ CacheService: Redis caching for performance
```

**PostGIS Integration**:
- **Coordinate Systems**: EPSG:4326 (WGS84) for storage, EPSG:3844 for Romanian calculations
- **Spatial Indexes**: Optimized GIST indexes for coordinate fields
- **Query Optimization**: Spatial query patterns for common operations
- **Performance**: <100ms target for spatial queries with caching

**Caching Strategy**:
- **Redis Integration**: Cache geocoding results and distance calculations
- **TTL Strategy**: 24 hours for geocoding, 1 hour for distance calculations
- **Cache Invalidation**: Smart invalidation for updated addresses
