- [x] Component library setup verified (Radix UI + shadcn/ui dependencies)
- [ ] Hello world verification (App.tsx creation and test build)
- [ ] API integration test (backend connection verification)

## Status
- [x] Initialization complete (VAN mode)
- [x] Planning complete (PLAN mode)
- [x] Technology validation 95% complete
- [x] Creative phases (UI/UX Design, Architecture Design) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Phase 1: Core Application Setup ✅ COMPLETE

## Creative Phases Required
- [x] 🎨 UI/UX Design Phase
  - Order management interface design
  - Form UX patterns and user workflows
  - Real-time status visualization design
  - Responsive design patterns
- [x] 🏗️ Architecture Design Phase
  - Frontend application architecture
  - State management patterns (Zustand stores)
  - API integration patterns (TanStack Query)
  - Component organization and reusability

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Application Setup (UI-001 - 3 SP)
1. [ ] Application Entry Points
   - [ ] Create src/main.tsx with React.StrictMode
   - [ ] Create src/App.tsx with routing setup
   - [ ] Setup index.html with proper meta tags
2. [ ] Routing Configuration
   - [ ] Configure React Router v6 with protected routes
   - [ ] Create route definitions for orders, dashboard, settings
3. [ ] Core Infrastructure
   - [ ] Setup TanStack Query client with proper defaults
   - [ ] Initialize Zustand stores (auth, orders, UI state)
   - [ ] Create axios instance with interceptors

### Phase 2: UI Foundation & Layout
1. [ ] shadcn/ui Component System
   - [ ] Initialize shadcn/ui with components.json
   - [ ] Install core components (Button, Input, Dialog, etc.)
   - [ ] Create custom theme configuration
2. [ ] Layout Components
   - [ ] Header component with navigation and user menu
   - [ ] Sidebar component with responsive behavior
   - [ ] Footer component with system status
   - [ ] PageLayout wrapper with consistent spacing

### Phase 3: Order Management Interface (UI-002 - 5 SP)
1. [ ] Order List View
   - [ ] OrderCard component with status badges
   - [ ] Pagination with TanStack Query
   - [ ] Filtering by status, date range, client
   - [ ] Search functionality with debouncing
2. [ ] Order Detail View
   - [ ] Complete order information display
   - [ ] Geographic route visualization
   - [ ] Document attachments section
   - [ ] Status history timeline
3. [ ] Order Creation Form
   - [ ] Multi-step form with validation
   - [ ] Address autocomplete integration
   - [ ] File upload for manual order creation
   - [ ] Real-time price estimation
4. [ ] Subcontractor Assignment
   - [ ] Assignment modal with recommendation engine
   - [ ] Subcontractor comparison interface
   - [ ] Assignment confirmation workflow
5. [ ] Real-time Updates
   - [ ] Server-Sent Events integration
   - [ ] Optimistic UI updates
   - [ ] Connection status indicator

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish
1. [ ] API Integration
   - [ ] Complete backend API integration
   - [ ] Error handling with user-friendly messages
   - [ ] Loading states for all async operations
2. [ ] Testing Implementation
   - [ ] Unit tests for core components
   - [ ] Integration tests for forms and API calls
   - [ ] E2E tests for critical user workflows
3. [ ] Performance Optimization
   - [ ] Lazy loading for routes and heavy components
   - [ ] Image optimization and caching
   - [ ] Bundle size analysis and optimization

## Dependencies
- ✅ Sprint 3 Backend API (fully functional)
- ✅ Node.js 18+ development environment
- ✅ Backend running on localhost:8000 with OpenAPI docs
- ✅ All npm dependencies installed and verified

## Challenges & Mitigations
- **Real-time updates complexity**: Implement SSE with TanStack Query integration
- **Form state management**: Use React Hook Form with Zod for type-safe validation
- **Component reusability**: Follow shadcn/ui patterns for consistent design
- **Performance with large datasets**: Implement virtual scrolling and pagination
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Use modern browser features with graceful fallbacks

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Frontend application builds and runs without errors
- [ ] All order management workflows functional
- [ ] Responsive design working on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Real-time updates working reliably
- [ ] Test coverage > 80% for critical components
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Integration with Sprint 3 backend fully functional

## Next Steps After Planning
1. **Recommended Next Mode**: CREATIVE MODE (for UI/UX and Architecture design)
2. **Creative Phase Focus**: Design order management interface and application architecture
3. **After Creative**: IMPLEMENT MODE for actual component development
